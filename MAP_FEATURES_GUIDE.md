# Map Features Guide

## New Features Added

### 1. Satellite View Toggle
You can now switch between street view and satellite view using the "Satellite View" button in the top-right corner of the map. This helps you better identify courts and their surroundings.

### 2. Draggable Location Marker
When adding a new location, you can now fine-tune its position by dragging the marker on the map. This is especially useful for precisely marking court locations.

**How to use:**
1. Start adding a location by clicking the "Add Location" button
2. After selecting a spot on the map, a draggable marker will appear
3. Drag the marker to adjust the exact position
4. The address will automatically update based on the new position

### 3. Conditional Lighting Option
The "Has lights for night play" option now only appears when "Outdoor" is selected as the venue type, since indoor venues typically have lighting.

### 4. Improved Button Positioning
The map control buttons (Current Location and Add Location) are now positioned to avoid overlapping with popups and dialogs, making them more accessible.

When adding a location, you can now see the exact coordinates in the location preview section, helping you verify the precise position.
